# Python-Tip-Distribution-Calculator
Identified inefficiencies in how cash tips were manually divided among Starbucks partners, often resulting in time-consuming math and inconvenient coin distribution. To streamline the process, I developed a Python program that calculates each partnerâ€™s share based on hours worked and evenly splits the total cash amount with minimal rounding. Built and deployed the tool, then shared it with team members to simplify daily operations and improve fairness and accuracy in tip distribution. This project reflects my ability to solve real-world problems using programming, as well as my initiative in applying technical skills to improve workplace processes.
